    "## What is memoization?\n",
    "Memoization simply means adding some memory to your function, so that it doesn't need to compute the same result twice. It's very useful when the function gets called a lot with the same inputs and when such calls are expensive to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is `functools.lru_cache`?\n",
    "It's a decorator from the `functools` module that lets you use memoization easily. It creates a dictionary that associates inputs and outputs of your function. That dictionary acts as a cache memory. We will see how to use this decorator below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Tower of Hanoi\n",
    "As an example, we will use a function that computes a solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which is stated as follows (see [Wikipedia â€“ Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Simpler_statement_of_iterative_solution)):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",
    "3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",

    "## Recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi\n",
    "We will use a simple recursive solution to this puzzle. Let's name the rods \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" from left to right. Starting with $n$ disks on rod \"A\", we first move the $n-1$ smallest disks to rod \"B\". How do we do that? We don't have to know it: that's the magic of recursive solutions! Then, we move the largest disk from rod \"A\" to rod \"C\". Finally, we move the $n-1$ smallest disks from rod \"B\" to rod \"C\". This solution is further detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Recursive_solution). Let's implement it!"
